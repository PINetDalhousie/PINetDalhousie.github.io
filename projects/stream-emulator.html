                        Stream processing is becoming mainstream. It is present in thousands of companies around the
                        globe and used in a variety of applications including real-time monitoring, data analytics,
                        car-trip pricing, credit card fraud detection, and many others. Despite the great success of the
                        stream processing paradigm, testing a networked stream processing application (particularly at
                        scale) is still a cumbersome and often expensive process. Existing approaches typically include
                        building an expensive testbed, applying for a slot on a community one (e.g., GENI, CloudLab) or
                        hiring a cloud-based set-up. On top of that, developers still need to spend significant amounts
                        of time configuring and managing their platforms, e.g., by connecting cluster nodes and
                        ingesting data. In this project, we aim at lowering the wall (from both time and money
                        perspective) for stakeholders to participate in the stream processing ecosystem. For that, we
                        are building a simple and easy-to-use prototyping tool for distributed stream processing
                        applications. It is a whole stream processing setup in a single server and in a matter of
                        minutes. We envision this work can also help paving the way for more reproducible research in
                        the stream processing domain, a basic need for the research community.
