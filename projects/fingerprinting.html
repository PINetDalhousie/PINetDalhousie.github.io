            While there has been an explosion in prevalence of Smart Homes and IoT devices recently,
            we have also seen that such devices pose a number of security and privacy risks. For example,
            the Mirai botnet successfully compromised over 100 thousand IoT devices to engage them in 
            Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Currently, we are working on 2 ways to make smart homes more 
            secure and private:

            1. To identify potentially compromised devices and mitigate their risks,
            fingerprinting has emerged as a suitable candidate. However, existing approaches
            are offline and server-based which makes them impractical in applications that require real-time 
            fingerprinting. Therefore, our lab has committed to contribute to this body of research by utilizing
            programmable switches to provide live fingerprinting with significantly less overhead as compared
            to existing approaches.

            2. Malicious actors can passively analyze internet traffic emitted by IoT devices and apply IoT fingerprints
            to identify events on IoT devices and profile the victim's behavior. IoT consumers may benefit greatly 
            from obfuscation methods that can render their public internet traffic immune to traffic analysis. However,
            existing defense mechanisms are too costly in performance and impractical in real-world deployment. 
            Therefore, we aim to develop a more efficient and practical defense system that protects IoT users from
            malicious actors.
