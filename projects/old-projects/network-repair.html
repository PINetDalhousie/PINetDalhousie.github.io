                        Networks have grown from small topologies connecting a dozen of devices to large, shared
                        infrastructures supporting
                        primary needs of our society. Today, we count on networked services for trading, commuting,
                        monitoring weather conditions,
                        meeting people. In order to provide reliable services, network operators need to cope with the
                        daunting challenge of
                        ensuring millions of flows from heterogeneous devices arrive at their destination on time and
                        showing a reasonable
                        throughput. Despite the significant advances recent Software Defined Networks (SDNs) provided
                        towards managing large
                        scale network infrastructures, they still fall short to enable fault-tolerant,
                        performance-guaranteed data transmissions
                        to the level next-generation applications such as 5G, smart cities, augmented reality and the
                        Tactile Internet demand.
                        In this project, we propose a new view to the problem of network reliability. Through Artificial
                        Intelligence (AI) and
                        Machine Learning (ML) techniques, we look for building a smart, highly scalable and robust
                        network repair system. Our
                        design will combine state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement
                        learning and graph neural
                        networks with high-performance and flexible network devices (e.g., P4 switches, NetFPGAs, and
                        SmartNICs) to detect
                        and correct network faults with high accuracy and in extremely short timescales. As a result,
                        this project will
                        promote the development of next-generation applications and their widespread adoption in
                        production environments.
