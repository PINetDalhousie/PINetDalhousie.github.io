        <p> We are passionate about all aspects of networked systems and applications, but you can find a summary of our main research interests in the above figure. Our projects usually include one or more of those topics. From an application
          perspective, our projects target smart cities, homes, agriculture, transportation, etc. These applications heavily rely on computer networks and networked systems that we design in collaboration with domain-specific experts. Furthermore, we
          focus on the needs of Atlantic Canada and thus also prioritize applications like ocean science and energy systems. Our interests are around performance, reliability, and security to realize the above applications in the networking services,
          where monitoring is orthogonal to these services. Our lab is specialized over time in three broad disciplines: programmable networking (e.g., SDN or NFV), machine learning, and optimization. These technologies have evolved for years, and we
          are still amazed at how powerful they are. We are big fans of the "networking for x" and "x for networking" jargon, so not rarely you will see an overlap among the technologies we mentioned. Finally, we are eclectic regarding the types of
          networks we target, ranging from IoT to data centers. That may sound a bit broad to you, but fortunately, the group can count on exceptional experts in both wired and wireless domains. </p>

        <!--<p> We are passionate for all aspects of networked systems and applications, but you can find a summary of our main research interests in the above figure. Our projects usually include one or more of those topics. If the figure looks a bit overwhelming for you, we can try to put that into words. First, from an application perspective, you will probably see our projects lying around areas such as AR/VR, smart homes and health science. We love collaborating with people and though these applications thelsemves are not our main expertise, they heavily rely on computer networks and networked systems and give us the opportunity to mingle with many fantastic researchers. We also enjoy supporting and helping our local community and that is why you will also see us doing investigations focused on ocean science, smart farming, and energy systems. We are proud to be in Atlantic Canada and live in a place where nature shines most of the year and is just by the ocean. Going one layer down is where the fun starts for us. We are mostly systems and networking people, from the kind very curious to know what are the causes of any performance, security or reliability issue. To be able to shed light into these issues, we often do extensive monitoring work too. Talking about the way we solve the research problems we face, the group specialized over the time in three broad disciplines: programmable networking (a.k.a. SDN), machine learning and optimization. These technologies have evolved for years (sometimes decades) and we are still amazed at how powerful they are (probably this is a feeling every computer scientist shares with us). We are big fans of the "networking for x" and "x for networking" jargon, so not rarely you will see an overlap among the technologies we mentioned above in our projects. Finally, we are eclectic regarding the types of networks we target, ranging from IoT to data centers. That may sound a bit broad, but fortunately the group can count on exceptional experts in both wired and wireless domains.</p>-->

	<p> Failures are common in computer networks (either data centers, ISPs or cloud provider WANs). If this was not enough, whenever a failure happens, performance requirements of business critical applications are usually violated. These failures are diverse in nature, and  range from equipment failures (e.g., a link failure or routing issue) to misconfigurations and other human-related problems (e.g., accidents, bugs, bad capacity planning or maintenance failures). In the last few years our group has been working to detect, explain and recover from failures as quickly as possible in large scale computer networks. In particular, we have focused on recent programmable network architectures (e.g., SDN/OpenFlow and P4). Also, we have been working closely to ensure that these networks can operate at high-speeds, despite the growing complexity of their control/data plane programs. Our list of active projects include:</p>

</div>

<br>

<div class="container">
Today we are literally surrounded by connected things. Smart homes, farms, cities, they are everywhere. Although these devices do not present much processing capacity, their applications often require extremely low latencies to work properly. Also, there are many additional constraints in these environments such as a limited energy budget or the huge amount of devices to configure/manage. Our group works to create more flexible and efficient IoT networks by: (i) developing new IoT device configuration/communication protocols based on programmable networking concepts; and (ii) intelligently offloading tasks to edge-based resources. See below some of our current projects:

</div>

<br>

<div class="container">
Security is always a primary concern whenever stakeholders deploy a new production system/application. In particular, distributed systems (e.g., IoT and cloud-based systems) are uniquely problematic because of their increased attack surface. As a result, we see new attacks on these systems literally every day. Our group is investigating how programmable networks can offer better support to secure distributed applications. More specifically, we look for network-based enhancements to both state-of-the-art and traditional security mechanisms, acting on the border between networking and security research. We are also involved in exploring the potential of AI/ML techniques to attack/defend distributed systems/applications. Find some of our projects below:
